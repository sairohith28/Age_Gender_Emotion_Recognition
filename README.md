# Deep-Surveillance-Monitor-Facial-Emotion-Age-Gender-Recognition-System
Computer Vision module for detecting emotion, age and gender of a person in any given image, video or real time webcam. A custom VGG16 model was developed and trained on open source facial datasets downloaded from Kaggle and IMDB. OpenCV,dlib &amp; keras were used to aid facial detection and video processing. The final system can detect the emotion, age and gender of people in any given image, video or real time webcam.
